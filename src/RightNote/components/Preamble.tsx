                    In early 2024 I was hired for a study by Dr.Kate Whitman for
                    Portsmouth University to scrape data from various music
                    venue sites as a part of a study into gender equality in the
                    music industry. I was then drafted to produce a series of
                    tracks that had both male and female versions, as well as
                    instrumental tracks, to gain data in a controlled study as
                    to participantsâ€™ preferences. I was tasked with writing
                    analytical software to go over the initial data.

                    Some of the tracks are derivative, using music beds and Ace
                    Studio vocal synthesis software to perform vocal lines, and
                    others were written and recorded by myself. Although the
                    idea was later dropped, the use of A.I.-generated music
                    covers was mooted as part of the study; I have included
                    these as part of the visual imagery.

                    Whilst I am not at liberty to impart any of the results of
                    the study, I was honoured to contribute and eagerly await
                    the publication.
